Studied Data: Use the Index, Luke! Chapter 1.

I learned that b-tree leafs use a doubly linked list to ensure efficient references between the row references. When a table is updated, it does not need to shift a whole load of the data, but instead where inserted, update the references to next and previous for those which newly reference it. 

I then learned how b-tree navigate. We have a root node of several values, and this is compared against from the top to see if it is >= the value we are searching for. When that hits, it goes to increasing levels of branch nodes and repeats, until it finds and matches on a leaf. 

Finally, i learned the reason of slow indexes in real life, may be down to issues such as indexes being made on columns without much unique data. This provides two issues. 

1. There may be many leaves corresponding to a hit, and the tree must keep traversing to reach the end of that hit. 
2. It may now attempt to read the reference of many hits from the leaf node if it contains many references.

Studied AZ-900, Completed Describe Cloud Computing on Microsoft Learn. 

Mostly a reminder than anything going over several aspects:

Cloud computing is the provision of computing resources over the internet. As in cases a provider issues a wealth of things, such as virtual machines, app services, databases, there is what is known as the shared ownership model. 

For instance, a Cloud SQL Database may be provisioned, but the customer is still responsible for the data and authorisation to access the database. Further to the responsibility to a customer, they may be provisioned a Linux VM, but from that moment it is down to the user to keep it updated, download any software required onto it, etc.


The most flexible offering, the provider is responsible for the hardware, connections, and physical security, otheriwse the customer is responsible for everything else. This is useful if you have highly custom requirements, need to match anything on prem. 

There are pros and cons to using cloud computing:

**Pros:**
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale up/down based on demand
- **Cost efficiency**: Pay only for what you use (no upfront hardware costs)
- **Global reach**: Deploy resources worldwide quickly
- **Maintenance**: No physical hardware maintenance required
- **Disaster recovery**: Built-in redundancy and backup options
- **Innovation**: Access to latest technologies and services
- **Availability**: High SLAs available (but comes at a cost)

**Cons:**
- **Internet dependency**: Requires reliable internet connection
- **Security concerns**: Data stored off-premises, potential compliance issues
- **Vendor lock-in**: Can become dependent on specific cloud provider
- **Latency**: Network delays for real-time applications
- **Cost unpredictability**: Usage-based billing can be hard to predict
- **Limited control**: Less control over underlying infrastructure

Additionally, there are then different cloud models based on how a company may provision their it resources.

**Public** 
A public cloud model is where someone provisions their resources from a provider which is accessible to anyone publicly, the datacentre in which your resources are provisioned from is not yours solely.

**Private** 
A private model is whereby the datacentre you provision your resources from is solely yours to use, this may be via a deal with a provider, or have used your own datacentre. 

**Hybrid**
A hybrid model is where a customer users a combination of the above, this allows sensitive applications and data to be stored in house, while others may be in the public datacentres. 

**Cloud Service Models:**

**SaaS (Software as a Service)**
- **What you manage**: Nothing - just use the application
- **What the provider manages**: Everything (infrastructure, platform, application)
- **Examples**: Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Dropbox, Gmail
- **Best for**: End users who need applications without technical overhead
- **Control level**: Minimal - just configuration and data

**PaaS (Platform as a Service)**
- **What you manage**: Applications and data
- **What the provider manages**: Infrastructure and platform (OS, runtime, middleware)
- **Examples**: Azure App Service, Google App Engine, Heroku
- **Best for**: Developers who want to focus on code, not infrastructure
- **Control level**: Moderate - you control the application but not the underlying platform

**IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
- **What you manage**: Applications, data, runtime, middleware, OS
- **What the provider manages**: Physical infrastructure (servers, storage, networking)
- **Examples**: Azure VMs, AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine
- **Best for**: IT teams who need full control over the environment
- **Control level**: High - you manage everything except the physical hardware

**Key Takeaway**: The "as a Service" models represent different levels of abstraction and responsibility sharing between you and the cloud provider.
