Studied Data: Use the Index, Luke! Chapter 1.

I learned that b-tree leafs use a doubly linked list to ensure efficient references between the row references. When a table is updated, it does not need to shift a whole load of the data, but instead where inserted, update the references to next and previous for those which newly reference it. 

I then learned how b-tree navigate. We have a root node of several values, and this is compared against from the top to see if it is >= the value we are searching for. When that hits, it goes to increasing levels of branch nodes and repeats, until it finds and matches on a leaf. 

Finally, i learned the reason of slow indexes in real life, may be down to issues such as indexes being made on columns without much unique data. This provides two issues. 

1. There may be many leaves corresponding to a hit, and the tree must keep traversing to reach the end of that hit. 
2. It may now attempt to read the reference of many hits from the leaf node if it contains many references.
